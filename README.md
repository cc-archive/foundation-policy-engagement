# foundation-policy-engagement

Creative Commons will create systemic tools out of lessons from existing policies in order promote open policy adoption within philanthropic foundations. We began a listening process with foundations through an earlier project. We will extend that process and develop a website or portal on the CC website dedicated to open licensing needs of foundation staff and grantees. The website will include the following types of resources, with a specific focus for foundation staff and foundation grantees:

* licensing how-to guides for foundation staff and grantees;
* best practices for marking/attribution;
* benefits to open licensing;
* case studies of existing foundation open policies;
* database of existing IP policy texts from existing foundation policies;
* educational resources on open licensing adapted from existing materials developed for US Department of Labor TAACCCT grantees.

In addition, Creative Commons will conduct outreach and provide support to currently engaged and prospective foundations willing to adopt an open policy for their own and grant-funded materials. A hands-on approach is desired in order to help foundations effectively implement an open licensing policy and support grantee compliance with the foundationâ€™s openness goals. CC staff will offer support services to all relevant foundation staff to ensure a successful adoption of open policies within the foundation. Support could include:

* legal support with foundation general counsel or legal staff on policy text drafting/adoption on all appropriate grantee documents (proposal and report templates, grantee letters/contracts, etc.);
* technical assistance for foundation web developers or grantees in order to license and mark works correctly;
* communications and promotional outreach to ensure accurate presentation of open policy details;
* strategic discussions with foundation program officers and leadership team regarding how to work with grantees to increase compliance.
